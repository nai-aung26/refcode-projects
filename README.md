## About Me

My name is Nai Sai Aung. I live in Decatur,GA. I love coding even I'm not an expert on coding. I started coding on May 2019. I started learned HTML and CSS in the first three months and I had my first blog [My website](https://nai-aung26.github.io/Nai/index.html). Now I'm learning Jekyll, Markdown and JavaScript. JavaScript was hard for me, but I keep learning steadily. I know I can do it! Thank you for visiting my blog. Have a nice day.
